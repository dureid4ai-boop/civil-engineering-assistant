# CEA — Project Kickoff Checklist (Generic)

> This checklist is generic. Do not store client-sensitive info in Git.

## 1) Project setup (internal)
- [ ] Create project folder structure (deliverables + working files)
- [ ] Create versioning approach for outputs (date + revision)
- [ ] Define roles: engineer, checker, approver
- [ ] Create a decision log for assumptions

## 2) Inputs to request from client (DO NOT store here)
- [ ] Site boundaries / survey (store privately)
- [ ] Client requirements (store privately)
- [ ] Applicable codes/standards (reference only)
- [ ] Architectural drawings (private)
- [ ] Geotechnical report (private)
- [ ] Utility constraints (private)

## 3) Early risk scan (generic)
- [ ] Missing data risk
- [ ] Conflicting drawings risk
- [ ] Scope creep risk (new requirements)
- [ ] Safety-critical items flagged for senior review

## 4) Output plan
- [ ] Define deliverables list (reports, drawings, BOQ, etc.)
- [ ] Define QA checkpoints (self-check + peer-check)
- [ ] Define milestone dates (internal)

## 5) Privacy gate (mandatory)
- [ ] Confirm: no client PDFs/DWGs/photos will be committed to Git
- [ ] Confirm: any real client content stored only in private location
