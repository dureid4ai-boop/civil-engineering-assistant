# Civil Engineering Assistant (CEA)

A practical assistant to help civil engineers produce consistent calculations, checklists, and reports — with strict privacy rules.

## Key rules
- No private client documents in Git.
- Prefer free/no-credit-card tools and platforms where possible.
- Decisions and scope are documented and versioned.

- docs/PROJECT_SPINE.md
- docs/CURRENT_STATE.md
